# Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-to-a-Foundation-Model

## Overview
This project focuses on applying **lightweight fine-tuning techniques** to foundational machine learning models, specifically leveraging **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**. Traditional fine-tuning methods require updating all model parameters, which can be computationally expensive. PEFT allows us to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by modifying only a small subset of parameters, significantly reducing memory and compute requirements while maintaining high performance.

The project integrates essential components of a **PyTorch** and **Hugging Face** workflow, covering **model loading, fine-tuning, evaluation, and inference**. This approach makes fine-tuning more accessible to researchers and developers working with limited computational resources.

## Key Features
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):** Implements advanced fine-tuning strategies, such as **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, **Prefix-Tuning**, and **Adapter Layers**, reducing training overhead.
- **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Fine-tunes models with minimal computational costs, making it accessible for users with limited hardware.
- **Comprehensive Model Evaluation:** Assesses model improvements through **loss, accuracy, runtime, memory usage, samples per second, and steps per second**.
- **Scalable and Modular Implementation:** Designed for easy adaptation, enabling the use of different **transformers architectures**, fine-tuning techniques, and datasets.

## Implementation Details
1. **Load and Evaluate a Pre-Trained Model**
   - The base model is initialized using **distilbert-base-uncased** for sequence classification.
   - The modelâ€™s performance is assessed on a test dataset before fine-tuning.

2. **Apply Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**
   - A **PEFT configuration** is created to define adapter parameters.
   - The model is fine-tuned using PEFT techniques, such as **LoRA**, which reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining accuracy.
   - Fine-tuning is performed over **multiple epochs** with adaptive learning rate scheduling.

3. **Perform Inference and Compare Performance**
   - The fine-tuned model is evaluated against the pre-trained model to measure improvements in performance.
   - Inference efficiency is tested to ensure the model remains lightweight while delivering high-quality predictions.
